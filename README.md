This script should be run after you open qbittorent, and point a torrent at the program.
It will automatically change the priority of the earlest episode being downloaded in a series within a torrent to maximum and then change it to the "not downloaded" status at the end to stop sharing that specific file
I have found this speeds up the overall download of a TV series
I have added in the ability to change all other files to "do not download" to speed things up a bit more.
This is especially useful when downloading in high quality where file sizes are larger, or obscure series so you can start to watch sooner.
