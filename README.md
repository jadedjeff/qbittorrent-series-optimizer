This script should be run after yuou open qbittorent.
It will automatically change the priority of the earlest episode being downloaded in a series within a torrent to maximum and then change it to the "not downloaded" status at the end to stop sharing that specific file
I have found this speeds up the overall download of a TV series
I could add in the ability to change all other files to "do not download" to speed things up a bit more, but haven't seemed to need to as I can start watching as soon as soon as the first is done.
This is especially useful when downloading in High quality where file sizes are larger.
